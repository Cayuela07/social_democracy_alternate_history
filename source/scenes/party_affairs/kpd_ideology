= Questions of Ideology

The KPD is at a crossroads, with different factions pushing for ideological leadership. What path should we take?

[? if ideology != 0 : We have previously chosen a [+ ideology +] ideology. Changing it will likely have drawbacks. ?]

- @revolutionary: The proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat must remain our goals.
- @soviet_marxism: The Marxism-Leninism of the Soviet Union is the correct path for our movement.
- @workers_front: We should work within the existing structures to build a broad workers' alliance.
- @united_front: We must collaborate with other leftist forces to resist reaction and fascism.
- @easy_discard
